    "text": "Empowering students by co-creating marine biodiversity education\nOBIS is the primary biodiversity platform dedicated to the marine environment, currently hosting over 125 million occurrence records along with a wealth of data related to abundance, environmental information, eDNA, and more. This renders OBIS an exceptional resource for marine researchers. Yet, many students are unaware of the full potential of OBIS capabilities.\nThe Propagules program want to bridge this gap by enriching higher education programs on marine sciences with OBIS content. Students will have the opportunity to explore, through innovative resources, how they can leverage OBIS data and products to unleash new scientific questions. This will be powered by new tools being developed by OBIS, as part of the recently created virtual laboratory.\nStudents enrolled in courses with Propagules content will also develop essential skills in data management, learning to navigate in the era of big data on biodiversity research. At the end, we anticipate paving the way for a newly skilled community of ocean scientists that can use OBIS information to address the challenges the oceans are facing.\nthe Propagules approach\nOBIS Propagules will form a community of trainers to co-create educational content designed to empower students with the skills to leverage biodiversity data and products to address the most pressing questions of today."
